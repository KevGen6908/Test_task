Hi everybody. This is a project where the Viterbi encoder and decoder class of arbitrary convolutional code is fully implemented. Also for this project was to simulate a binary symmetric channel with a given error probability and by creating a csv file in Python, a graph was created of the dependence of the probability of a bit error at the decoder output
on the probability of an error in the channel. The graph itself is presented below.
