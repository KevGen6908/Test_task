# Test_task
Hi everybody. This is a project where the Viterbi encoder and decoder class of arbitrary convolutional code is fully implemented. Also for this project was to simulate a binary symmetric channel with a given error probability and by creating a csv file in Python, a graph was created of the dependence of the probability of a bit error at the decoder output
on the probability of an error in the channel. The graph itself is presented below.

The fast Fourier transform for complex values is also partially implemented, but it only works for lists of values that are multiples of two.

!!!For the Fourier transform, you can prove the fftw3.h library or comment in the file main.cpp all attributes associated with it.!!!
